This is because, when your phone is in airplane mode, it turns off all wireless connections, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. These connections consume battery power even when your phone is not in use.According to a study conducted by Stanford University, putting your phone in airplane mode can increase charging speed by up to 20%. The study found that airplane mode reduces battery consumption by up to 10%, resulting in a quicker charging time."

The teeth of Livyatan measured 36.2 cm (1.19 ft), and are the largest biting teeth of any known animal, excluding tusks. It is distinguished from the other raptorial sperm whales by the basin on the skull spanning the length of the snout."

Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25–38 mm (1–1.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high-water-content food item."
